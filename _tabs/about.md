## About Me
I'm Kamek and I like programming and computers. I've been programming for most of my life, one way or another. I am currently brushing up on my Typescript and C#. Likewise, I like RPGs and multiplayer games. Not only that, but I'm a fan of Daggerfall and Fallout 1 and 2, old-school RPGs. Still haven't played Disco Elysium, I quit playing games a few years ago cus I was low on time and all that. I tend to hyper-focus on games and things, and it eats my time, so I try to avoid those things now. Elden Ring I'll make an exception for!

## Content
I'll be writing about games, role-playing, programming, and other cool tech things I find or build. Right now, we at Iron Circle Studios are working on some
video content, and tutorials, and creating a website. We've been busy, so stay tuned for more content.
